## Usage

> **Prerequisites**: Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.


### Extraction
```sh
# One-time usage for extraction
npx wpress extract your-migration.wpress

# Or install it locally
npm i -g wpress
wpress extract your-migration.wpress
```
#### Options

You can customize the standard behavior of the `wpress` command with these custom options that can be added:

```sh
wpress extract --out ./alternate-output your-migration.wpress
```

| Option            | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-o, --out <dir>` | Define an alternate directory where the archive should be extracted to.               |
| `-f, --force`     | Skip the check if the output directory already exists and override the content in it. |


### Compression
```sh
# One-time usage for compression
npx wpress compress your-directory-name your-output.wpress

# Installed version
wpress compress your-directory-name your-output.wpress

```

The command then creates a new directory with the same name (in this example `your-migration/`) where it extracts the content of the archive into.

This was a fork of <b>Felix Haus</b></sub>](https://github.com/ofhouse)<br /><sub>[Website](https://felix.house/) â€¢ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ofhouse)</sub> wpress-extract but refactored to support compress

The functionality of this package is inspired by the [wpressor](https://github.com/fifthsegment/wpressor) tool.
Since the provided binaries stopped working on MacOS and no solution for Linux is available I created this tool as a cross-platform alternative.
